# ES6

## Introduction to ES6

ECMAScript is a standardized version of JavaScript with the goal of unifying the language's specifications and features. As all major browsers and JavaScript-runtimes follow this specification, the term ECMAScript is interchangeable with the term JavaScript.

Most of the challenges on freeCodeCamp use the ECMAScript 5 (ES5) specification of the language, finalized in 2009. But JavaScript is a n evolving programming language. As features are added and revisions are made, new versions of the language are released for use by developers.

The most recent standardized version is called ECMAScript 6, released in 2015. This new version of the language adds some powerful feeatures that will be covered in this section of callenges, including:

* Arrow functions
* Classes
* Modules
* Promises
* Generators
* `let` and `const`

**Note**
Not all browsers support ES6 features. If you use ES6 in your own projects, you may need to use a program (transpiler) to convert your ES6 code into ES5 until browsers support ES6.

## Explore Differences between the var and let Keywords

One of the biggest problems with declaring vaiables with the `var` keyword is that you can overwrite variable declarations without an error.

```js
var camper = 'James';
var camper = 'David';
console.log(camper); // logs 'David'
```

As you can see in the code above, the `camper` variable is originally declared as `James` and then overridden to be `David`. In small application, you might not run into this type of problem, but when your code becomes larger, you might accidentally overwrite a variable that you did not intend to overwrite. Because this behavior does not throw an error, searching and fixing bugs becomes more difficult.

A new keyword called `let` was introduced in ES6 to solve this potential issue with the `var` keyword. If you were to replace `var` with `let` in the variable declarations of the code above, the result would be an error.

```js
let camper = 'James';
let camper = `David`; // throws an error
```

This error can be seen in the console of your browser. So unlike `var`, when using `let`, a variable with the same name can only be declared once. Note the `"use strict". This enables Strict Mode, which catches common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions. For instance:
```js
"use strict";
x = 3.14; // throws an error because x is not declared
```
## Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords

When you declare a variable with the `var` keyword, it is declared globally, or locally if declared inside a function.

The `let` keyword behaves similary, but with some extra features. When you declare a variable with the `let`keyword inside a block, statement, or expression, its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.

For example:
```js
var numArray = [];
for (var i = 0, i < 3; i++) {
    numArray.push(i);
}
console.log(numArray); // returns [0,1,2]
console.log(i); // returns 3
```
with the `var` keyword, `i` is declared globally. So when `i++`is executed, it updates the global variable. This code is similar to the following:

```js
var numArray = [];
var i;
for (i = 0; i < 3;i++ ) {
    numArray.push(i);
}
console.log(numArray);  // [0,1,2]
console.log(i);         // 3
```
This behavior will cause problems if you were to create a function and store it for later use inside a for loop that uses the `i` variable. This is because the stored function will always refer to the value of the updated global `i` variable.

```js
var printNumTwo;
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    if (i === 2) {
        printNumTwo = function() {
            return i;
        };
    }
}
console.log(printNumTwo()); // returns 3
```
As you can see, `printNumTwo()`prints 3 and not 2. This is because the value assigned to `i` was updated and the `printNumTwo()`returns the global `i` and not the value `i` had when the function was created in the for loop. The `let` keyword does not follow this behavior:
```js
'use strict';
let printNumTwo;
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    if (i === 2) {printNumTwo = function(){ return i;};}
}
console.log(printNumTwo());     // returns 2
console.log(i);                 // returns "i is not defined"
```
`i` is not defined because it was not declared in the global scope. It is only declared within the for loop statement. `printNumTwo()` returned the correct value because three different `i` variables with unique values (0,1 and 2) were created by the `let` keyword within the loop statement.

## Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword

The keyword `let` is not the only new way to declare variables. In ES6, you can also declare variables using the `const` keyword.

`const` has all the awesome features that `let` has, with the added bonus that variables declared using `const` are read-only.
They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with `const`, it cannot be reassigned.

```js
"use strict";
const FAV_PET = "Cats";
FAV_PET = "Dogs";   // returns error
```
As you can see, trying to reassign a variable declared with `const` will throw an error. You should always name variables you don't want to reassign using the `const` keyword.

This helps when you accidentally attempt to reassign a variable that is meant to stay constant. A common practice when naming constants is to use all uppercase letters, withWords seperated by an underscore.

**Note:** It is common for developers to use uppercase variable identiiers for immutable values and lowercase or camelCase for mutable values (objects and arrays). In a later challenge you will see an example of a lowercase variable identifier being used for an array.
